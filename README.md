DAWN OF THE QUALITY CONTROL DEPARTMENT

3D FPS game for Game Development Technics course. This game designed as a sequel story for the QUALITY CONTROL DEPARTMENT (you can see that game from [here](https://github.com/mericozer/OGT5016-3D-Project)).

In the sequel, aggressive robots that work in quality control tests captured the whole department. The Head of the department calls a professional to handle the situation, you. Quality Control Department consists of labyrinth-like corridors to make unwanted visitors lose their way. As an armed soldier, you have to reach the energy source that gives robots the energy and shut it off. You'll find your way with a tablet that shows you the paths of the department but be careful, the tablet's battery is limited so use it carefully.

Good Luck!
